2022 - 2023 &\textbf{Defining Ecosystem Boundaries within a Stable, Diverse and Extensive Alarm Management Platform} \\
&Independent and generic specification of a stable, extensive and deeply integrated alarm management platform to assure digital services.
It is believed a particular focus on ethics and an extensive test framework make this specification a leading candidate for the Commonwealth's intergrated systems architecture.
Follows ideal (peoples) theory in the liberal tradition, rather than a nation states approach.
The written specification and belief ontology is available from: \url{https://github.com/aidan-parkinson/digital-assurance}.\\
2021 - 2022 &\textbf{Rapid Building Performance Audit} \\
&A cross-platform application in alpha testing to support rapid professional building performance audits and report generation on-site. The Flutter application is integrated with an AWS Amplify service with data held in a MongoDB Atlas cluster. \\
2020 - 2021 &\textbf{Learning IoT Web Application} \\
&A progressive web application and cloud services to be used as a learning resource to support a syllabus of executive education in internet-of-things. Employs EC2, ECS, S3, Certificates Manager, Route 53, React, Eclipse Mosquitto, an ELK stack and RaspberryPi. The source-code is available at \url{github.com/aidan-parkinson}.\\
2019&\textbf{FaucetSDN: Device Automated Qualification (DAQ)} \\
&Defining and witnessing device test functionality of a software tool for qualifying network edge devices for enrolment on an enterprise network. DAQ software is designed for continuous deployment as a package of Docker containers running on a Faucet compatible Openflow switch controller. The code is managed in a public repository and available at: \url{github.com/faucetsdn/daq}. \\
2017&\textbf{An Application for Monte-Carlo Simulations of Building Lifecycle Cost} \\
&I have independently developed a Python class and functions to automate Monte-Carlo simulations of building life-cycle cost scenarios. This tool estimates costs for offering Schoolhaus buildings to schools as a service. The source-code is available at: \url{github.com/realfeed/lifecycle-cost}. \\
2016 - 2022&\textbf{busmethodology.org.uk} \\
&The BUS Methodology Partner network consists of ~35 licensed partners who are provided with the training and resources to deliver occupant satisfaction evaluation and benchmark analysis using the BUS Methodology tool. I took a leading role in a transformation of the service to automate processes, enhance customer experience and deliver the database of >70000 consistent response records in a way that should realise more of the products potential. I specified and provided content for: a static HTML marketing website; an Angular web user-interface; an EVE REST API; and a MongoDB database. Deployment of this domain is somewhat automated with Terraform and employs various AWS services (S3, Elasticbeanstalk, Secrets Manager, Cloudfront, Web Application Firewall, Route 53, IAM, Certificates Manager) and MongoDB Atlas. All domain services are now available at the domain and I continue to project manage the business: \url{busmethodology.org.uk}. \\
2013 - 2015&\textbf{Evaluating the Energy Performance of Buildings within a Value at Risk Framework} \\
&I assessed socio-economic risks to the energy performance of commercial property in the UK under explorative scenarios describing plausible development of the national energy system towards 2050. A Rapid Calculator was developed from the assumptions of the DECC 2050 Pathways using Matlab, validated through random sampling. Exhaustive exploration of the Rapid Calculator through batch processing was employed to identify time-series energy system pathways for 4 diverse scenarios at reasonable limits of plausibility. The scientific publications are available at:

2017 - 2018&\textbf{Infrastructure Upgrade, Animal Plant Health Agency} \\
&Replacement of Building Management Systems (BMS) across a site that includes ~15 high containment laboratories at Weybridge. I made recommendations of alarm classifications, conducted a gap analysis of required system instrumentation through plant surveys, interviewed laboratory operators and scientists and developed specifications for the new site BMS control room and BMS head-end user interface. \\
2016 - 2017&\textbf{Sustainability Strategy and Carbon Management Improvement Plan, University of Warwick} \\
&I created a projection tool in MS Excel to explore sensitivity of the campus to a range of possible energy efficiency interventions. \\
2015 - 2019&\textbf{BUS Methodology, Various Clients Worldwide} \\
&An occupant satisfaction survey tool licensed to a partner network. As part of a small specialist team, I taught classroom training sessions, developed an e-learning course and contributed to BUS Partner Meetings in addition to my contributions to the web domain. \\
